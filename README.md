# Next Word Prediction AI Tool

This repository contains a Next Word Prediction AI tool, using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model to predict upcoming words based on input text. By providing an initial phrase and specifying the number of words desired, the model generates the next words in the sequence.

#How It Works
Input Processing: Input text is processed and tokenized.
Model Training: The LSTM model is trained on a sample dataset to learn language patterns.
Prediction: The model predicts the next words based on the input phrase and the specified word count.


# Features
Customizable word prediction based on user input.

LSTM-based language model for natural text extension.

Simple API served via Flask.

# Technology Stack
Machine Learning Framework: TensorFlow/Keras for LSTM model.

Web Framework: Flask for serving the API.

Languages: Python
